15.6.3.2. Cylc Broadcast

Usage: cylc [control] broadcast|bcast [OPTIONS] REG

Override [runtime] config in targeted namespaces in a running suite.

Uses for broadcast include making temporary changes to task behaviour, and task-to-downstream-task communication via environment variables.

A broadcast can target any [runtime] namespace for all cycles or for a specific cycle.  If a task is affected by specific-cycle and all-cycle broadcasts at once, the specific takes precedence. If a task is affected by broadcasts to multiple ancestor namespaces, the result is determined by normal [runtime] inheritance. In other words, it follows this order:

all:root -> all:FAM -> all:task -> tag:root -> tag:FAM -> tag:task

Broadcasts persist, even across suite restarts, until they expire when their target cycle point is older than the oldest current in the suite, or until they are explicitly cancelled with this command.  All-cycle broadcasts do not expire.

For each task the final effect of all broadcasts to all namespaces is computed on the fly just prior to job submission.  The --cancel and --clear options simply cancel (remove) active broadcasts, they do not act directly on the final task-level result. Consequently, for example, you cannot broadcast to "all cycles except Tn" with an all-cycle broadcast followed by a cancel to Tn (there is no direct broadcast to Tn to cancel); and you cannot broadcast to "all members of FAMILY except member_n" with a general broadcast to FAMILY followed by a cancel to member_n (there is no direct broadcast to member_n to cancel).

To broadcast a variable to all tasks (quote items with internal spaces):
  % cylc broadcast -s "[environment]VERSE = the quick brown fox" REG
To do the same with a file:
  % cat >'broadcast.rc' <<'__RC__'
  % [environment]
  %     VERSE = the quick brown fox
  % __RC__
  % cylc broadcast -F 'broadcast.rc' REG
To cancel the same broadcast:
  % cylc broadcast --cancel "[environment]VERSE" REG
If -F FILE was used, the same file can be used to cancel the broadcast:
  % cylc broadcast -G 'broadcast.rc' REG

Use -d/--display to see active broadcasts. Multiple --cancel options or multiple --set and --set-file options can be used on the same command line. Multiple --set and --set-file options are cumulative.

The --set-file=FILE option can be used when broadcasting multiple values, or when the value contains newline or other metacharacters. If FILE is "-", read from standard input.

Broadcast cannot change [runtime] inheritance.

Arguments:
   REG               Suite name

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p CYCLE_POINT, --point=CYCLE_POINT
                        Target cycle point. More than one can be added.
                        Defaults to '*' with --set and --cancel, and nothing
                        with --clear.
  -n NAME, --namespace=NAME
                        Target namespace. Defaults to 'root' with --set and
                        --cancel, and nothing with --clear.
  -s [SEC]ITEM=VALUE, --set=[SEC]ITEM=VALUE
                        A [runtime] config item and value to broadcast.
  -F FILE, --set-file=FILE, --file=FILE
                        File with config to broadcast. Can be used multiple
                        times.
  -c [SEC]ITEM, --cancel=[SEC]ITEM
                        An item-specific broadcast to cancel.
  -G FILE, --cancel-file=FILE
                        File with broadcasts to cancel. Can be used multiple
                        times.
  -C, --clear           Cancel all broadcasts, or with -p/--point,
                        -n/--namespace, cancel all broadcasts to targeted
                        namespaces and/or cycle points. Use "-C -p '*'" to
                        cancel all all-cycle broadcasts without canceling all
                        specific-cycle broadcasts.
  -e CYCLE_POINT, --expire=CYCLE_POINT
                        Cancel any broadcasts that target cycle points earlier
                        than, but not inclusive of, CYCLE_POINT.
  -d, --display         Display active broadcasts.
  -k TASKID, --display-task=TASKID
                        Print active broadcasts for a given task
                        (NAME.CYCLE_POINT).
  -b, --box             Use unicode box characters with -d, -k.
  -r, --raw             With -d/--display or -k/--display-task, write out the
                        broadcast config structure in raw Python form.
  --user=USER           Other user account name. This results in command
                        reinvocation on the remote account.
  --host=HOST           Other host name. This results in command reinvocation
                        on the remote account.
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output mode.
  --debug               Output developer information and show exception
                        tracebacks.
  --port=INT            Suite port number on the suite host. NOTE: this is
                        retrieved automatically if non-interactive ssh is
                        configured to the suite host.
  --use-ssh             Use ssh to re-invoke the command on the suite host.
  --ssh-cylc=SSH_CYLC   Location of cylc executable on remote ssh commands.
  --no-login            Do not use a login shell to run remote ssh commands.
                        The default is to use a login shell.
  --comms-timeout=SEC, --pyro-timeout=SEC
                        Set a timeout for network connections to the running
                        suite. The default is no timeout. For task messaging
                        connections see site/user config file documentation.
  --print-uuid          Print the client UUID to stderr. This can be matched
                        to information logged by the receiving suite server
                        program.
  --set-uuid=UUID       Set the client UUID manually (e.g. from prior use of
                        --print-uuid). This can be used to log multiple
                        commands under the same UUID (but note that only the
                        first [info] command from the same client ID will be
                        logged unless the suite is running in debug mode).
  -f, --force           Do not ask for confirmation before acting. Note that
                        it is not necessary to use this option if interactive
                        command prompts have been disabled in the site/user
                        config files.
